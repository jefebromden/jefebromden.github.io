# Cmus - C Music Player
## Install
```bash
dnf install cmus
```

## Quickstart
If it is the first time you use it, read the `cmus-tutorial` Man Page

The keybindings are very confortable for your fingertips, you don't have to move your hands like on other players:

Left Hand:
- `z`: Previous
- `x`: Toggle Play/Pause
- `c`: Pause
- `v`: Stop
- `b`: Next
- `Space`: Beggining of track

Right Hand:
- `Left Arrow`: Backward 5 seconds
- `Right Arrow`: Foreward 5 seconds

For *albums*, just add the `Shift` key:
- `Shift+Z`: Previous album
- `Shift+B`: Next album
